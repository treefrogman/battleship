# battleship-server
Node.js server of multi-player battleship, Cooley style.

## Clients
I plan to develop clients for several different platforms.
- **Test Harness / Node.js** because robots are faster at playing.
- **JavaScript / HTML5 / SVG** would be the most natural place for me to start, and it can form the basis of a **Chrome (OS) App**.
- **Command Line** would be fun, and Lynn would enjoy it.
- **Android App** would be a good learning experience.
- **iPhone App** could be a pain to test, but would be good to learn.
- **macOS App** …is it worth it?
- **Windows App** …um…haha?
- **Chrome (OS) App** because maybe it's better to start from scratch or at least think of it as a separate venture.
